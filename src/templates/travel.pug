        h2 Traveling to South Jersey
        p If you‚Äôre flying to the wedding, you'll want to fly into <b>Philadelphia International Airport (PHL)</b>.
        p If you're taking the train, Bridgeton, NJ is equidistant to <b>Philadelphia 30th Street Station</b> and <b>Wilmington Penn Station</b>.
        p From Philadelphia or Wilminton you'll need to rent a car (or an expensive Uber/Lyft) to Bridgeton, NJ (where the wedding is) or neighboring Vineland, NJ (where the hotel blocks are).
        p It is about a 1 hour drive to Bridgeton or Vineland from Philadelphia.

        h2 Where to stay
        p We have a hotel block at 2 neighboring hotels in nearby Vineland, NJ: a <a href="#">Hampton Inn</a> (newer hotel, $169/night) and a <a href="#">Wingate</a> (next door to Hampton Inn, $119/night). The hotel blocks have a 2-night minimum. If you want to make a 1 night reservation, you can book your room outside of the block.
        p If you stay in either of these hotels, we‚Äôll have a shuttle service that can take you to and from the venue!
        p <b>üè®Hampton Inn:</b> To <a href="#">book a room at the Hampton Inn, click here</a>, or call <b>(856) 405-0600</b> and mention the <b>"Rosholm-Wasserman Wedding"</b>
        p <b>üè®Wingate:</b> To book a room at the Wingate, call <b>(856) 690-9900</b> and mention the <b>"Rosholm-Wasserman Wedding"</b>
